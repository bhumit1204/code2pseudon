**Bridging Code & Clarity with AI**
---

## ðŸ”¹ Short Description

**Code2Pseudo**: Your AI-powered Flask app converts code to pseudocode & vice-versa using Meta Llama 3.3. Browse community snippets & chat-generate pseudocode, with data stored in Zilliz Milvus. Simplify code comprehension effortlessly!

## ðŸ”¸ Long Description

**Code2Pseudo**, developed by **Team Code Catalysts** for the *Trae AI Hackathon*, is an innovative Flask application designed to bridge the gap between complex programming languages and easily understandable pseudocode.

Our app facilitates **bi-directional conversion**, allowing users to transform code from virtually any language into clear pseudocode and, importantly, convert pseudocode back into functional code. This capability enhances code comprehension, simplifies technical explanations for non-developers, and streamlines the development workflow.

At its core, Code2Pseudo leverages the powerful **Meta Llama 3.3 8B model**, fine-tuned with precise system prompts for highly accurate and contextually relevant conversions. Using **OpenRouter** ensures seamless and efficient interaction with the AI model.

Beyond conversion, Code2Pseudo offers a unique **community browsing feature** powered by **Zilliz Milvus**, allowing users to explore a growing repository of shared code and pseudocode snippets. A dynamic **chat-based pseudocode generator** enables interactive pseudocode creation from natural language input.

> **Code2Pseudo is more than a tool; it's a collaborative platform aimed at making programming logic accessible to everyone.**
